# bonline-imageresizer-delete-images

## Naive Implementation

To run...

```
npm install

node index.js
```

# I do not recommend running this file yet. This is simply the fastest solution to remove all of our images from image resizer. It is not reusable and is not up to the standard I'd like it to be.
